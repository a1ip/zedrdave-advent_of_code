* To run `.py` code: `python3 ./FILE.py`
* To run `.c` code: `gcc FILE.c -o out.exe && ./out.exe`

OCaml fans: [right this way](https://github.com/regnat/aoc-2019)â€¦

## 1
### 1.1

Ideal job for Python + `numpy` with vectorisation. Might be a tad more compact in `R`.

Didn't initially check for negative vals. Turned out there weren't any, but probably not good practice.

### 1.2

Simpler version of [the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html) (minus fuel exhaustion). I think it even gets a mention in [XKCD's What If](https://what-if.xkcd.com) book versionâ€¦

Can probably be solved using arithmetico-geometric series convergence (though dealing with the `floor` would be a pain).

## 2

Solved it in Python, then dusted off gcc to see if it looked nicer (it doesn't, but I suspect it might, if there start being a richer opcode grammar).

For the sake of it, I added all necessary checks in the C code, but I reckon size could be halved by just relying on correctly formed input.

### 2.1

Guess who's got two thumbs and wasted 10 mins by failing to read the last line of instructionsâ€¦ ðŸ‘ˆðŸ˜‘ðŸ¤Ÿ

Good reminder that good coding starts with reading the specs well.

### 2.2

Wondering if there's a more convoluted but nicer way to solve, than brute-forcing. Something about deconstructing all the opcodes and identifying all params pointing to `0`?

Also went full [Arbitrary Condiment](https://www.xkcd.com/974/), with an alternate [2_2_bis.c](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code_2019/blob/master/02/2_2_bis.c) version that could handle arbitrary opcodes.

### 3.1

Went with detecting intersections between two sets of segments (restricted to vertical or horizontal).

Thought that foregoing binary-tree sweep search implementation was already total brute-force, then watched [this guy's 5 mins solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPQp60q9GA) and realised how hilariously off-base I was. There is indeed no good reason to deal with continuous-plane segments, rather than using the discrete grid nature of the problem, and exhaustively list all points (wouldn't scale for larger input/grid size, but who cares).

Decidedly not a natural competitive-coder here. (but still a valuable lesson in the dangers of overthinking and premature optimisation)

### 3.2

Made code clearer, life easier and bugs rarer, by implementing a quick wrapper class `Point(x, y)`: dealing with `p.x`/`p.y` rather than `p[0]`/`p[1]`â€¦

**TIL** that `x1 < y < x2` is perfectly good Python, and indeed equivalent to `x1 < y and y < x2` as one would hope/expect (obvious in retrospect).

Can easily optimise by adding: `if step_counts and s1_steps + s2_steps > min(step_counts): continue`, but lose the ability to debug the process.

## 4

Very uninspired bruteforcing. Neither concise nor elegant, and didn't have the time to revisit with something nicer.

Had I realised that the monotony conditions ensured only one `d+` pattern match (eg no `113311` or `134156`) would have greatly simplified the counting problem!

Favourite solution (not mine):
```
check = lambda n: list(n) == sorted(n) and 2 in map(n.count, n)
sum(check(str(n)) for n in range(123456, 654321))
```

## 5

My [arbitrary condiment version of day 2](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code_2019/blob/master/02/2_2_bis.c) turned out to be useful after all, and not arbitrary enough. Silly restrictions like:
* Fixed-sized opcodes
* Opcodes only able to affect instruction pointer relative to current position

â€¦ both made life harder for Day 5.

Did a [clean rewrite](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code_2019/blob/master/02/2_2_bis.c) that now uses a global IP (and memory buffer), allowing ops to do pretty much anything (I'm sure I'll be proven wrong on that at some future date). Initially went hogwild with macros, then chose clarity over concision, and used proper functions.

**TIL**: C ternary operator is *not* a macro (duh), and therefore: `(a ? b : c) = 1` does not compile (depending on compiler, it might compile to something useless).


## 6

Expecting part 2 to be a bit more solid, I went straight to a graph lib, with `networkx`. Code took a couple minutes (after spending 10 mins realising I had not used any graph lib in 2 years, did not remember any, googling around, and figuring out how to use it).

Turns out it works just fine with a [basic node parents dict](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code_2019/blob/master/06/6_2_b.py). But something tells me more serious graphs will make a comeback.
