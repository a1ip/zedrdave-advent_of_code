* To run `.py` code: `python3 ./FILE.py`
* To run `.c` code: `gcc FILE.c -o out.exe && ./out.exe`

OCaml fans: [right this way](https://github.com/regnat/aoc-2019)â€¦

### 1.1

Ideal job for Python + `numpy` with vectorisation. Might be a tad more compact in `R`.

Didn't initially check for negative vals. Turned out there weren't any, but probably not good practice.

### 1.2

Simpler version of [the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html) (minus fuel exhaustion). I think it even gets a mention in [XKCD's What If](https://what-if.xkcd.com) book versionâ€¦

Can probably be solved using arithmetico-geometric series convergence (though dealing with the `floor` would be a pain).

## 2

Solved it in Python, then dusted off gcc to see if it looked nicer (it doesn't, but I suspect it might, if there start being a richer opcode grammar).

For the sake of it, I added all necessary checks in the C code, but I reckon size could be halved by just relying on correctly formed input.

### 2.1

Guess who's got two thumbs and wasted 10 mins by failing to read the last line of instructionsâ€¦ ðŸ‘ˆðŸ˜‘ðŸ¤Ÿ

Good reminder that good coding starts with reading the specs well.

### 2.2

Wondering if there's a more convoluted but nicer way to solve, than brute-forcing. Something about deconstructing all the opcodes and identifying all params pointing to `0`?

Also went full [Arbitrary Condiment](https://www.xkcd.com/974/), with an alternate [2_2_bis.c](https://github.com/zedrdave/advent_of_code_2019/blob/master/02/2_2_bis.c) version that could handle arbitrary opcodes.

### 3.1

Went with detecting intersections between two sets of segments (restricted to vertical or horizontal).

Thought that foregoing binary-tree sweep search implementation was already total brute-force, then watched [this guy's 5 mins solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMPQp60q9GA) and realised how hilariously off-base I was. There is indeed no good reason to deal with continuous-plane segments, rather than using the discrete grid nature of the problem, and exhaustively list all points (wouldn't scale for larger input/grid size, but who cares).

Decidedly not a natural competitive-coder here.

### 3.2

Made code clearer, life easier and bugs rarer, by implementing a quick wrapper class `Point(x, y)`: dealing with `p.x`/`p.y` rather than `p[0]`/`p[1]`â€¦

TIL that `x1 < y < x2` is perfectly good Python, and indeed equivalent to `x1 < y and y < x2` as one would hope/expect (obvious in retrospect).

Can easily optimise by adding: `if step_counts and s1_steps + s2_steps > min(step_counts): continue`, but lose the ability to debug the process.
